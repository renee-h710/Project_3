## Real Estate Data Summary
In the midst of another housing crisis, with prices and rates continuing to skyrocket, it is a topic on many peopleâ€™s minds. Specifically, we will focus on the following areas: housing occupancy, housing size, home value, and mortgage status. Our website will look at each of these factors individually for the year 2021.

Our website has three interactive links you can choose from:

## Housing Occupancy
This will reflect where there is excess housing (high numbers of vacancies) with pie charts.

## Housing Values
This will reflect how many houses there are per cost bracket for each state. There is a drop down menu so the user can choose which state to view the data in a bar cart format.

## Gross Rent as Percentage of Household Income
This will reflect the average percentage of household income is used towards rent. As you hover over each state, you will be able to view that statistic.
